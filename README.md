# Battle Simulator
### Developer's Notes
* I aimed to write everything as clean as possible and apply patterns of OOP appropriately.
* I considered SoC and SOLID principles while I'm designing the architecture of the code.

### About the game
* Two armies of random units are generated. 
* A random shape, size and color characteristic would assigned to each unit. 
* According to their physical characteristics, each unit gets assigned basic fighting stats.
* Armies of squares and spheres fight with each other to be victorious!
